# Final Project

An end-to-end data project for the final CodeClan and PDA Data Science project. Written in Python in Jupyter notebooks.

For this project, the project brief was written for the "client" Newark Liberty International Airport to investigate flight departure delays.

The following approach was taken:

- Clean data and source additional data (pandas)
- Exploratory data analysis (seaborn, matplotlib, folium, geopandas)
- Model departure delay (Random Forest classifier, scikit learn)
- Deliver business insights
