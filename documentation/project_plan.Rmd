# Flight delays

## Context

#### Business intelligence and data-driven decision making

What insights can the business/organisation gain from your analysis and how will your analysis help the business/organisation make better decisions? 

* insights - data-driven exploratory analysis to provide insight on the impact of weather on flight delay.
Also consideration will be given to other factors such as airline carrier, frequency of flights and departure airport.

* better decisions - the report will allow Newark airport to determine if it is worth investing in improving facilities to allow aircraft to take off in all types of weather. OR whether there might be other areas which would benefit from investment which could also reduce flight delays.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) counts flights as delayed if they depart 15 minutes or later than their scheduled time.

#### Domain knowledge and the business context

Briefly describe the business/organisation and where your analysis fits within its aims/activity.

Newark Airport (or Newark Liberty International Airport) is one of the three major airports in the New York metropolitan area. 

Along with the other two major New York airports, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGardia Airport, Newark Airport is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority owns 5 airports in total.

Recently, $2.7 billion was invested to build a new Terminal One to replace Terminal A at Newark Airport. Other parts of the redevelopment program are focused on increasing airfield paving, redesigning roadways and improving parking.

Analysis fits in with the business aim for???

Business context:
Reducing flight delays is important to ensure a high quality of service for the airport. knowing what the primary cause for delays is can advice the airport authority as to what measures it needs to invest most in. Improving infrastructure or improving facilities to deal with poor weather conditions.

An American study on 2007 flight data estimated that delayed flights has cost the US economy a total of nearly 33 billion dollars.

Flights may be delayed due to reasons within the air carrier's control such as maintenance or issues with staffing or crew or for reasons outside the air carrier's control such as extreme weather delay, national aviation system delay. Over a third of the main cost of delay is fuel costs. With the aviation industry focusing on improving sustainability reducing unnecessary fuel use is paramount.

Optimizing processes and efficiently using resources are key to reducing flight delays and airlines and airports are using data analytics to improve on-time performance.

## Data

#### Internal and external data sources

Briefly describe your data sources and which were internal (provided by the organisation) and external (not sourced from the organisation's data)

#### Types of data

What kind of data did you work with? E.g. categorical and numerical data and their sub-types.

#### Data formats

What format did your data come in? E.g. all downloaded flat files (CSV) or any data from APIs, scraping etc.

#### Data quality and bias

Briefly describe the quality of the data and whether you have any reasons to suggest the data is biased e.g. only data from a specific demographic even though a broader demographic would be of interest to the organisation.

## Ethics

#### Ethical issues in data sourcing and extraction

Do you have any ethical concerns regarding the sourcing and extraction of your data? 

#### Ethical implications of business requirements

Are there any ethical implications of the business requirements?

## Analysis

#### Stages in the data analysis process

What were the main stages in your data analysis process?

#### Tools for data analysis

What were the main tools you used for your analysis?

#### Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis

Please report under which of the below categories your analysis falls **and why** (can be more than one) 

::: {.emphasis}
**Descriptive Analytics** tells you what happened in the past.

**Diagnostic Analytics** helps you understand why something happened in the past.

**Predictive Analytics** predicts what is most likely to happen in the future.

**Prescriptive Analytics** recommends actions you can take to affect those outcomes.
